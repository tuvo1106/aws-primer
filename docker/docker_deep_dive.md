# Docker Deep Dive

## Introduction to Docker

**What is Docker?**

- Docker:
  - Docker, Inc. the company
  - Docker, the container runtime and orchestration engine
  - Docker, the open-source project (Moby)

**The Company**

- Docker, Inc.:
  - Based in San Francisco
  - Founded by Solomon Hykes
  - Start as a PaaS provider called dotCloud
  - dotCloud leveraged Linux containers
  - Their internal tool used to manage containers was nick-named Docker
  - In 2013 dotCloud was rebranded as Docker

**The Runtime and Orchestration Engine**

- Most people are referring to the Docker Engine
  - Two main editions:
    - Enterprise Edition (EE)
    - Community Edition (CE)
  - Both are released quarterly:
    - CE is supported for 4 months
    - EE is supported for 12 months

**The Open-Source Project**

- Moby:
  - The upstream project of Docker
  - Breaks Docker down into more modular components
  - Code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/moby/moby

**Why Use Docker?**

- Docker Use Cases:
  - Dev/Prod parity:
    - Dev and Production environment are the same
    - Bugs in Production can be replicated in Development
  - Simplifying Configuration:
    - Lets you put your environment and configuration into code and deploy it
    - Allows the same Docker configuration to be used in a variety of environments
    - Decouples infrastructure requirements from the application environment
  - Code Pipeline Management:
    - Build standards and repeatable processes
  - Developer Productivity
  - App Isolation
  - Server Consolidation
  - Debugging Capabilities
  - Multi-tenancy

## Docker Under the Hood

### Architecture Overview

- Client-server architecture
- Client talks to the Docker daemon
- The Docker daemon handles:
  - Building
  - Running
  - Distributing
- Both communicate using a REST API:
  - UNIX sockets
  - Network interface

**The Docker daemon (dockerd)**:

- Listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects:
  - Images
  - Containers
  - Networks
  - Volumes

**The Docker client (docker)**:

- Is how users interact with Docker
- Sends commands to dockerd

**Docker registries:**

- Stores Docker images
- Public registry such as DockerHub
- Let you run your own private registry

**Docker objects:**

- Images:
  - Read-only template with instructions for - creating a Docker container
  - Image is based on another image
  - Create your own images
  - Use images published to a registry
  - Use a Dockerfile to build images
- Containers:
  - Runnable instance of an image
  - Connect a container to networks
  - Attach storage
  - Create a new image based on its current state
  - Isolated from other containers and the host machine
- Services
  - Scale containers across multiple Docker - daemons
  - Docker Swarm
  - Define the desired state
  - Service is load-balanced

**Docker Swarm:**

- Multiple Docker daemons (Master and Workers)
- The daemons all communicate using the Docker API
- Supported in Docker 1.12 and higher

---

### The Docker Engine

- Modular in design:
  - Batteries included but replaceable
- Based on open-standards outline by the Open Container Initiative
- The major components:
  - Docker client
  - Docker daemon
  - containerd
  - runc
- The components work together to create and run containers

**A Brief History of the Docker Engine**

- The first release of Docker:
  - The Docker daemon:
  - Monolithic binary
  - Docker client
  - Docker API
  - Container runtime
  - Image builds
  - Much more...
- LXC:
  - Namespaces
  - Control groups (cgroups)
  - Linux-specific

**Refactoring of the Docker Engine**

- LXC was later replaced with libcontainer:
  - Docker 0.9
  - Platform agnostic
  - Issues with the monolithic Docker daemon:
- Harder to innovate
  - Slow
  - Not what the ecosystem wanted
- Docker became more modular:
  - Smaller more specialized tools
  - Pluggable architecture
- Open Container Initiative:
  - Image spec
  - Container runtime spec
  - Version 1.0 release in 2017
  - Docker Inc. heavily contributed
  - Docker 1.11 (2016) used the specification as much as possible
- runc:
  - Implemenation of the OCI container-runtime-spec
  - Lightweght CLI wrapper for libcontainer
  - Create containers
- containerd:
  - Manages container lifecycle
    - Start
    - Stop
    - Pause
    - Delete
  - Image management
  - Part of the 1.11 release
- shim:
  - Implemenation of daemonless Containers
  - containerd forks an instance of runc for each - new container
  - runc process exits after the container is created
  - shim process becomes the container parent
  - Responsible for:
    - STDIN and STDOUT
    - Reporting exit status to the Docker daemon

---

### Running Containers

`docker container run -it --name <NAME> <IMAGE>:<TAG>`

- Creating a container:
  - CLI use for executing a command
  - Docker client uses the appropriate API payload
  - POSTs to the correct API endpoint
  - Docker deamon receives instructions
  - Docker deamon calls containerd to start a new container
  - Docker daemon uses gRPC (a CRUD style API)
  - containerd creates an OCI bundle from the Docker image
  - Tells runc to create a container using the OCI bundle
  - runc interfaces with the OS kernal to get the constructs needed to create a container
    - This includes namespaces, cgroups, etc.
  - Container process starts as a child process
  - runc exits once the container starts
  - Process is complete, and container is running

---

### Docker Images and Containers

- What are Docker images?
  - Files comprised of multiple layers
  - Execute code in a Docker container
  - Built from the instructions
  - Use images to create an instance of a container
- Docker images and layers
  - Image are made of multiple layers.
  - Each layer represents an instruction in the - image’s Dockerfile.
  - Each layer except, the very last one, is read-only.
  - Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it.
  - Layers are stacked on top of each other.
  - Containers add new writable layers on top of the underlying layers
  - All changes made to a running container is made to the Container layer
- What are containers?
  - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- Container and layers
  - Top writable layer
  - All changes are stored in the writable layer
  - The writable layer is deleted when the container is deleted
  - The image remains unchanged

    - Repositories
    - Teams and Organizations
    - Official Images

  `docker container run –d –name myContainer busybox`

---

### Exposing and Publishing Container Ports

- Exposing:
  - Expose a port or a range of ports
  - This does not publish the port
  - Use `--expose [PORT]`

`docker container run --expose 1234 [IMAGE]`

- Publishing:
  - Maps a container's port to a host`s port
  - `-p or --publish` publishes a container's port(s) to the host
  - `-P, or --publish-all` publishes all exposed ports to random ports

```
docker container run -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT] [IMAGE]
docker container run -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT]/tcp -p [HOST_PORT]:[CONTAINER_PORT]/udp [IMAGE]
docker container run -P
```

- Lists all port mappings or a specific mapping for a container:

`docker container port [Container_NAME]`

---

### Executing Container Commands

- Executing a command:
  - Dockerfile
  - During a Docker run
  - Using the exec command
- Commands can be:
  - One and done Commands
  - Long running Commands
- Start a container with a command:

`docker container run [IMAGE][cmd]`

- Execute a command on a container:

`docker container exec -it [NAME][cmd]`

- Example:

```
docker container run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
docker container ps
docker container exec -it [NAME] /bin/bash
docker container exec -it [NAME] ls /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

---

### Container Logging

- Create a container using the weather-app image.

`docker container run --name weather-app -d -p 80:3000 linuxacademycontent/weather-app`

- Show information logged by a running container:

`docker container logs [NAME]`

- Show information logged by all containers participating in a service:

`docker service logs [SERVICE]`

- Logs need to be output to STDOUT and STDERR.
- Nginx Example:

```
RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \
    && ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

- Debug a failed container deploy:

```
docker container run -d --name ghost_blog \
-e database__client=mysql \
-e database__connection__host=mysql \
-e database__connection__user=root \
-e database__connection__password=P4sSw0rd0! \
-e database__connection__database=ghost \
-p 8080:2368 \
ghost:1-alpine
```

```

- Run ifconfig to view the bridge interface for br02:

`ifconfig`

- Inspect the br02 network:

`docker network inspect br02`

- Prune all unused networks:

`docker network prune`

- Create a network with an IP range:

```
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/16 --gateway 10.1.0.1 --ip-range=10.1.4.0/24 --driver=bridge --label=host4network br04
```

- Inspect the br04 network:

`docker network inspect br04`

- Create a container using the br04 network:

```
docker container run --name network-test01 -it --network br04 centos /bin/bash
```

- Install Net Tools:

```
yum update -y
yum install -y net-tools
```

- Get the IP info for the container:

`ifconfig`

- Get the gateway info the container:

`netstat -rn`

- Get the DNS info for the container:

`cat /etc/resolv.conf`

**Assigning IPs to a container:**

- Create a new container and assign an IP to it:

```

```

- Get the IP info for the container:

`docker container inspect network-test02 | grep IPAddr`

- Inspect network-test03 to see that br01 was removed:

`docker container inspect network-test04`

**Networking two containers**

- Create an internal network:
